# FHIRWatch
Welcome to FHIRWatch!

## Overview
FHIRWatch is an MVP Blazor Webassembly static web app for comparing data synchronized between FHIR API and Microsoft Cloud for Health.

## Architecture
A Blazor WebAssembly (wasm) application using the pattern of micro-frontends implemented by lazy-loading UI "modules" only when requested by navigation events from the client.

## Get Started
Here's what you'll need to run this application in your own environment.

### FHIR API (R4)
You will need access to a FHIR API that meets the HL7 R4 spec requirements. 
Host your own with one of these popular offerings:
* [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/fhir-portal-quickstart)
* [Azure FHIR Server (OSS)](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/QuickstartDeployPortal.md)
* [Firely Server](https://fire.ly/products/firely-server/)

OR, use one of these [publicly available test servers](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing).

### Web Host
There are many options for hosting a Blazor WebAssembly application. This repo contains a Github Action workflow to automatically deploy the site to Azure Static Web Apps. 
Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/deploy-blazor) to learn more.

Other options include:
* Azure App Service
* Azure Blob Storage static web
* [and more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
